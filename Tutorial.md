# Introduction
I appreciate your interest in the game, this "tutorial" will be long but very thorough. <br>
I've attempted to break things down into sections and sub-sections for easier access.

# Table of Contents
[The Basics](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/blob/main/Tutorial.md#the-basics)

# The Basics
## Choices & Input
The game is 99.8% based on numerical inputs (Ex: 1, 23, 206, 2020) followed by `Enter`
You will be displayed a number of choices depending on what you're doing and you'll have to enter the number of the option you desire.

## The 2 Most Important Things To Note
1. Read Carefully!
2. Save OFTEN! Auto save on or not, always a good idea to save.

## Main Menu
Should look something very similar to this: <br>

Mostly self-explanatory <br>
`New Game` Where you create a new character, you technically have unlimited save files. <br>
`Load Save` Load an existing game file to continue your adventure. <br>
`Delete Save` Delete a save file (irreversible) <br>
`Exit to Desktop` Closes the game <br>
`Website` Opens our website in your default browser. <br>
`Join Discord Community` (Highly Recommended) Opens a link to our Discord Server in your default browser. <br>

To begin create a New Game and follow the prompts until you end up at the `Action Menu`

## Leveling Method (Important)
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 024008](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/619cd8a6-a11a-4779-a697-8245cbf8b98f) <br>
The game supports Auto Leveling & Manually Leveling *BUT* you can't change this in the settings later so please pay attention when you make your selection! <br>

## Action Menu
**NOTE: This file has opted for Manually Leveling so that's why there's `9. Level Up` <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 024820](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/613171f6-d3ec-4ef5-ac64-d2f102691027) <br>
`Travel (Current Regional Location)` The main gameplay loop will be traveling, this will be covered in it's own section. <br>
`Go To Town` This also will be covered in it's own section, but there are some extra activites and NPCs here among other things. <br>
`View Character` Takes you to another menu with prompts pertaining to your character, once again will hve it's own section. <br>
`Settings` Where you can change some gameplay settings, settings are based on the save file they are *NOT* global <br>
`Help` Will be a more streamlined tutorial. <br>
`Save` Saves the game and display's the last time this file has been saved. <br>
`Quit to Main Menu` You will be prompted to save or not before returning the the `Main Menu` <br>
`Level Up` If opted into Manual Leveling you will have the option to level up. <br>

## Settings
I won't reiterate the settings, the picture explains everything. These are also what the settings are by default. <br>

**Recommendations** <br>
For new players play with `Auto Save AGGRESSIVE` <br>
Unless you have a reason you should keep `Auto File Cleanup` ON <br>
Try out `Simplified Gear View` OFF at least once to see if you like view or not <br>

## Save Files
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 023640](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/5b4ed580-ffe4-4908-8e68-213261a8fc08) <br>
`[M] & [A]` Saves tagged with M are manually saved files and saves tagged with A are auto saved files. <br>
File Name Structure: [Save Type] + Character Name + Level at time of save + Class + | Save Date & Time <br>

# Traveling
Traveling is where everyhing happens. Everytime you travel there are 15-17 different things that can happen. I like to call these `Travel Cases` <br>
To further break it down, there is `Standard Traveling` and `Regional Traveling`. Obviously it's random but  <br>
depending on the outcome you may be encounter one of the 10 Standard Cases or 5 Regional Cases, every region is unique and offers different challenges and rewards! <br>
Regions: Forest, Swamp, Badlands, OCean, Volcano, Mountain, Desert, Warzone. <br>
*Traveling is jam packed with quests, secrets, and easter eggs so be on the look out!* <br>

# Town

`Shop` Where you can buy & sell items & materials! <br>
`Inn` Every 5 minutes you can rest here for free, or pay 500g to rest. <br>

`Bank` Where you can deposit an withdraw gold. <br>
`Caravan` You can reduce the effects of *rng* and travel to any of the regions... For a price of course! <br>

I appreciate your interest in the game, this "tutorial" will be long but very thorough. <br>
I've attempted to break things down into sections and sub-sections for easier access.

# The Basics
## Choices & Input
The game is 99.8% based on numerical inputs (Ex: 1, 23, 206, 2020) followed by `Enter`
You will be displayed a number of choices depending on what you're doing and you'll have to enter the number of the option you desire.

## The 2 Most Important Things To Note
1. Read Carefully!
2. Save OFTEN! Auto save on or not, always a good idea to save.

## Main Menu
Should look something very similar to this: <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 022744](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/780c949a-a735-44be-b983-758e00c7d49c) <br>
Mostly self-explanatory <br>
`New Game` Where you create a new character, you technically have unlimited save files. <br>
`Load Save` Load an existing game file to continue your adventure. <br>
`Delete Save` Delete a save file (irreversible) <br>
`Exit to Desktop` Closes the game <br>
`Website` Opens our website in your default browser. <br>
`Join Discord Community` (Highly Recommended) Opens a link to our Discord Server in your default browser. <br>

To begin create a New Game and follow the prompts until you end up at the `Action Menu`

## Leveling Method (Important)
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 024008](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/619cd8a6-a11a-4779-a697-8245cbf8b98f) <br>
The game supports Auto Leveling & Manually Leveling *BUT* you can't change this in the settings later so please pay attention when you make your selection! <br>

## Action Menu
**NOTE: This file has opted for Manually Leveling so that's why there's `9. Level Up` <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 024820](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/613171f6-d3ec-4ef5-ac64-d2f102691027) <br>
`Travel (Current Regional Location)` The main gameplay loop will be traveling, this will be covered in it's own section. <br>
`Go To Town` This also will be covered in it's own section, but there are some extra activites and NPCs here among other things. <br>
`View Character` Takes you to another menu with prompts pertaining to your character, once again will hve it's own section. <br>
`Settings` Where you can change some gameplay settings, settings are based on the save file they are *NOT* global <br>
`Help` Will be a more streamlined tutorial. <br>
`Save` Saves the game and display's the last time this file has been saved. <br>
`Quit to Main Menu` You will be prompted to save or not before returning the the `Main Menu` <br>
`Level Up` If opted into Manual Leveling you will have the option to level up. <br>

## Settings
I won't reiterate the settings, the picture explains everything. These are also what the settings are by default. <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 030211](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/89e4b6aa-8c96-48f2-ba5d-9762401e4f48)
**Recommendations** <br>
For new players play with `Auto Save AGGRESSIVE` <br>
Unless you have a reason you should keep `Auto File Cleanup` ON <br>
Try out `Simplified Gear View` OFF at least once to see if you like view or not <br>
**Simplified Gear View ON: <br>**
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 114350](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/d24db74a-743d-411a-8a76-c1fe14068ca9) <br>
**Simplified Gear View OFF: <br>**
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 114503](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/fc1f9113-dcff-4ad5-ad4a-b42596d208a1) <br>

## Save Files
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 023640](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/5b4ed580-ffe4-4908-8e68-213261a8fc08) <br>
`[M] & [A]` Saves tagged with M are manually saved files and saves tagged with A are auto saved files. <br>
File Name Structure: [Save Type] + Character Name + Level at time of save + Class + | Save Date & Time <br>

## Level Up <br>
Everytime you level up you gain: <br>
3 Stat Points <br>
2 Attribute Points <br>
1 Skill Point <br>
Max Health +55 <br>
Max Stamina + 2 <br>
Max Power + 3 <br>
Defense + 1 <br>

# Traveling
Traveling is where everyhing happens. Everytime you travel there are 15-17 different things that can happen. I like to call these `Travel Cases` <br>
To further break it down, there is `Standard Traveling` and `Regional Traveling`. Obviously it's random but  <br>
depending on the outcome you may be encounter one of the 10 Standard Cases or 5 Regional Cases, every region is unique and offers different challenges and rewards! <br>
Regions: Forest, Swamp, Badlands, OCean, Volcano, Mountain, Desert, Warzone. <br>
*Traveling is jam packed with quests, secrets, and easter eggs so be on the look out!* <br>

# Town
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 110708](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/7209c371-71e8-416f-8843-cee001f45811) <br>
`Shop` Where you can buy materials & potions, and sell gear! <br>
`Inn` Every 5 minutes you can rest here for free, or pay 500g to rest. <br>
`Blacksmith` Will have it's own section but you can: Buy armor & weapons, Upgrade armor & weapons, and Forge armor, weapons & other items <br>
`Bank` Where you can deposit an withdraw gold. <br>
`Caravan` You can reduce the effects of *rng* and travel to any of the regions... For a price of course! <br>
`Battle Tower` Mid game content that will net you a lot of gold and experience, as well as some `Skill Points` <br>
`Dungeon` Mid-End game content, this will NOT be futher explained... Good luck! :) <br>
`Arena` You can fight numerous enemies in a row for increasing rewards! <br>
`Abandoned Church` It's abandoned... Or is it? <br>

# Character

You must unlock the skill before you can upgrade it! <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 143240](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/d311041e-dfcc-4911-937d-525e5ce469bf) <br>

## Blacksmith
### Buying Armor
**Note at the time of writing there is no timed shop reset, every time you view the armor or weapons for sale new ones will generate** <br>
3 Armors are generated around your current level and can be purchased. <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 113036](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/2b07f014-8b07-4d09-ba1d-a48e4b78f452) <br>

### Buying Weapons 
5 Weapons are generated around your current level and cab be purchased. <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 113209](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/333456f8-d6a0-4179-8400-9b68bbc9fea0) <br>

### Upgrading
**Note this is the same for Armor. Rings/Accessories CANNOT be upgraded** <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 113705](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/8525b332-a487-4657-8ee9-c23b4c5d6adc) <br>
`Upgrade` Will upgrade the gear 1 time as long as you have the required gold. Weapons & Armors max out at 10 Upgrades. <br>
`Upgrade As Much As Possible` Will upgrade the gear as many times as possible with your currently held gold. <br>
**Maxed out gear will have an ++ at the end of it's name** <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 113913](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/2f217bfe-b3b5-4696-a68e-d58b3c9b104f) <br>

### Forging
I won't go over forging because the in-game menus explain it all very clearly. :D

# Combat
This is an RPG afterall, fighting is the main source of well everything in the game. <br>
![image](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/d25e208c-f3bc-41f8-b4f0-336d48e1025a) <br>
Combat is turned based always starting with the player, some skills and other variables can change the flow of combat dramatically. <br>
`Attack` A random number is rolled between you Minimum Attack & Maximum Attack values and that's how much damage you will do to the enemy - their Defense value <br>
`Skills` If you have any, this is where you can use them during combat <br>
`Potions` DOES NOT TAKE A TURN, where you can consume potions <br>
`Brace` ENDS TURN, you brace for impact and reduce incoming damage by 50% during the next attack against you <br>
`Run` 50% Chance to escape combat, if you fail your turn ends <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 120444](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/58128bd7-3918-4650-bd3b-8837ecce5a4d) <br>
Defeating enemies will almost always net you Experience and Gold! <br>
When you see the `[+]` symbol that means something has been added to your inventory, typically Materials or Gear. <br>

# Advanced
Time for some more advanced topics.

## Time
Every 24 Real Minutes = 1 In-Game Day <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 114801](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/0edcad33-8c93-4db8-bd09-c32e5375c008) <br>
![Screenshot 2023-12-04 114907](https://github.com/Galondor/AstralOdyssey/assets/103967053/dc573ab5-03f3-420a-af1e-ff4722d06b37) <br>

## Status Effects
`BLEEDING` Bleed doesn't end until combat ends, every turn the enemy will take 10% of their max health as damage <br>
`SOAKED` Increases the potency of some skills... <br>

## Blessings
You can obtain blessings in various ways, unfortunately I won't spill on any. <br>
I will say that most times you can obtain them through Traveling. <br>
Typically Blessings have powerful increases to your stats, some Blessings even give you new skills! <br>
Some Blessings are required for quests and other things... <br>

## Gear Rarities: <br>
`Poor` 60% Chance <br>
`Quality` 25% Chance <br>
`Pristine` 10% Chance <br>
`Flawless` 4% Chance <br>
`Perfect` 1% Chance <br>
Depending on the piece of gear the rarity will increase certain stats.

## Difficulties
You get the idea. <br>
